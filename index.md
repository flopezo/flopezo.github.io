I am a biologist interested in the evolution of social behavior. Specifically, I focus on social wasps in the subfamily Vespinae (yellowjackets and hornets) and study their evolutionary relationships and molecular evolution using specific gene sequences and large collections of expressed genes (transcriptomes). I am currently a Gerstner postdoctoral fellow at the American Museum of Natural History.
