I am a Ph.D. candidate in the Agnarsson Lab at the University of Vermont. My general research interests are phylogenetics and trait evolution. My dissertation research is focused on elucidating the evolutionary relationships of wasps in the subfamily Vespinae, which includes hornets and yellowjackets, using targeted genes and transcriptome sequencing. Furthermore, I investigate the evolution of behavioral traits within Vespinae using phylogenetic comparative methods. More recently, I have begun working on diversification patterns and biogeography of Caribbean spiders.
